# Perceptron ‚Äì The Foundation of Neural Networks

### Basic Idea:

A perceptron takes several binary inputs, applies weights, sums them, and passes the result through an activation function to generate an output.

## ‚úÖ 1. What is a Perceptron?

A **Perceptron** is the simplest type of **artificial neural network**, used primarily for **binary classification** problems.

It mimics a **biological neuron** where:

* Inputs = Dendrites
* Weights = Synaptic strengths
* Summation = Soma
* Activation = Axon firing

---

## ‚úÖ 2. Historical Background

* **Invented by Frank Rosenblatt** in 1958.
* Initially developed for **image recognition**.
* Considered one of the earliest models in AI and ML.

---

## ‚úÖ 3. Perceptron Model

### Mathematical Formula:

Let:

* $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ = Input features
* $w_1, w_2, ..., w_n$ = Weights
* $b$ = Bias term
* $f$ = Activation function

Then,

$$
y = f(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b)
$$

Or in vector form:

$$
y = f(\vec{w} \cdot \vec{x} + b)
$$

---

## ‚úÖ 4. Perceptron Algorithm

### Goal:

Find the optimal weights and bias that minimize the error in prediction.

### Steps:

1. Initialize weights $w_i$ and bias $b$ with small random values.
2. For each training example:

   * Compute output $y$
   * Compare with true label $y_{true}$
   * Update weights and bias using:

$$
w_i \leftarrow w_i + \eta (y_{true} - y_{pred}) x_i
$$

$$
b \leftarrow b + \eta (y_{true} - y_{pred})
$$

Where $\eta$ is the **learning rate**.

## ‚úÖ 5. Activation Function

In a basic perceptron, we use a **Step function**:

![Step Function](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coderanandmaurya/Deep_Learning/main/deep%20learning%20IMG/step%20function.png)

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Special Note:

If $z = 0$, the step function still outputs 1. This is an important edge case.

Other functions used in advanced models:

* Sigmoid
* Tanh
* ReLU

### üîÅ Comparison: Step Function vs. Sigmoid Function

| Feature         | Step Function                   | Sigmoid Function                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Output Range    | 0 or 1                          | (0, 1)                                   |
| Differentiable  | No                              | Yes                                      |
| Use in Backprop | Not suitable                    | Suitable for gradient-based learning     |
| Formula         | $f(z) = 1 \text{ if } z \geq 0$ | $f(z) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-z}}$            |
| Smoothness      | Discontinuous                   | Smooth and continuous                    |
| Use Case        | Simple binary decisions         | Probabilistic interpretation in networks |

## ‚úÖ 6. Geometric Interpretation

A perceptron tries to find a **linear boundary** that separates data into two classes. In 2D, this is a **straight line**; in 3D, it‚Äôs a **plane**; in higher dimensions, it‚Äôs a **hyperplane**.

### Decision Boundary Equation:

$$
w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + b = 0
$$

Points on one side will output 0, on the other side will output 1.

---

## ‚úÖ 7. Real-Life Analogy

Think of a perceptron like a simple decision rule:

> "If the number of spammy keywords exceeds a threshold, mark the email as spam."

Inputs = Words in email, Weights = importance of each word, Threshold = bias.

---

## ‚úÖ 8. Foundation for Backpropagation

The original perceptron cannot use **backpropagation** because the step function is **not differentiable**. But it laid the foundation for:

* **Multi-layer Perceptrons (MLP)**
* **Deep Neural Networks**, which use differentiable functions like **sigmoid**, **tanh**, and **ReLU**.

---

## ‚úÖ 9. Example: AND Gate Using Perceptron

| x1 | x2 | Output (AND) |
| -- | -- | ------------ |
| 0  | 0  | 0            |
| 0  | 1  | 0            |
| 1  | 0  | 0            |
| 1  | 1  | 1            |

Design perceptron with weights $w_1 = 1, w_2 = 1, b = -1.5$:

$$
y = f(x_1 + x_2 - 1.5)
$$

---

## ‚úÖ 10. Limitations of Perceptron

* **Can only solve linearly separable problems** (e.g., AND, OR).
* **Fails on problems like XOR**, which are not linearly separable.
* Solved later using **Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLP)** or **Neural Networks**.

## ‚úÖ 11. Python Implementation

```python
import numpy as np

# Step function
def step_function(x):
    return 1 if x >= 0 else 0

# Perceptron class
class Perceptron:
    def __init__(self, input_size, learning_rate=0.1):
        self.weights = np.zeros(input_size)
        self.bias = 0
        self.lr = learning_rate

    def predict(self, x):
        z = np.dot(self.weights, x) + self.bias
        return step_function(z)

    def train(self, X, y, epochs=10):
        for _ in range(epochs):
            for xi, yi in zip(X, y):
                y_pred = self.predict(xi)
                error = yi - y_pred
                self.weights += self.lr * error * xi
                self.bias += self.lr * error

# Training data for AND gate
X = np.array([[0,0], [0,1], [1,0], [1,1]])
y = np.array([0, 0, 0, 1])

# Train the perceptron
p = Perceptron(input_size=2)
p.train(X, y)

# Test
for x in X:
    print(f"Input: {x}, Output: {p.predict(x)}")
```

## ‚úÖ 15. Case Study: Perceptron for Email Spam Detection

### Problem:

Classify whether an email is spam or not based on presence of keywords.

### Features:

* x1 = presence of word ‚Äúfree‚Äù (1 if yes, 0 if no)
* x2 = presence of word ‚Äúbuy‚Äù (1 if yes, 0 if no)

### Labels:

* 1 = Spam
* 0 = Not spam

### Sample Dataset:

| x1 (free) | x2 (buy) | Label (Spam?) |
| --------- | -------- | ------------- |
| 0         | 0        | 0             |
| 0         | 1        | 1             |
| 1         | 0        | 1             |
| 1         | 1        | 1             |

### Model:

Let weights = \[1, 1], bias = -0.5

Then output:

$$
y = f(x_1 + x_2 - 0.5)
$$

### Result:

* If either "free" or "buy" appears, or both, email is classified as spam.
* If neither appears, classified as not spam.

This demonstrates how a simple perceptron can implement binary classification logic.
