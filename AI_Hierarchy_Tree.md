# Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the science of making machines think and act like humans. This tree presents the complete landscape of AI — including types, agent models, techniques, and real-world examples — in a way that's understandable for anyone.

## Foundations of AI

AI draws from many disciplines. These form its philosophical, mathematical, and engineering roots:

* Philosophy: What is intelligence? Can machines think?
* Mathematics: Logic, probability, and optimization
* Psychology: How humans think and learn
* Computer Science & Engineering: Building hardware and software
* Linguistics: Understanding and generating language
